# refactor-horiseon-marketingsol

This project required to carefully review the codebase for a marketing agency's website called "Horiseon".

I changed the name of the title that appears on the tab to make it clear and concise by naming it "Horiseon Digital Marketing Solutions" instead of "website".

In the header section, the word "Horiseon" did not have a logical structure, thus I rewrote it by putting the "span" and  "h1" tags in the right place. 

I then proceeded to review all links in the header to make sure they were working properly. I realized that one of the links was not functioning ("Search Engine Optimization") since it did not have the "href" attribute in the anchor element with the corresponding ID. I proceeded to add it on.

None of the images had the alt element. I added the corresponding element to meet accessibility standards.

I set up comments in the CSS file according to the organization of the semantic HTML elements. In order to do that, I had to change the position of some of the elements and classes so that they match with the website's display organization.

Here is a screenshot of the final website:
