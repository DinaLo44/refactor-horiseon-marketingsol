# refactor-horiseon-marketingsol

This project required to carefully review the codebase for a marketing agency's website called "Horiseon" and refactor it in order to make it more organized and cleared.

The changes included replacing multiple HTML elements such as <div>, ids and classes to give them more clarity for what they meant to be part of. 
  
 The title was changed from "website" to the actual name displyed in the footer to be consistent.
 
In the header section, the word "Horiseon" did not have a logical structure, thus it was rewritten by putting the "span" and  "h1" tags in the right place. 

The link for the Search Engine Optimization navigation item was not working at all, thus it was necessary to add the respective "id" to work properly.
  
The main image code was established in the CSS file. Thus it was established in the HTML file with its corresponding alt attribute.

The alt attribute was added into all images tags.

Comments in the CSS file were stated according to the organization of the semantic HTML elements. 

Here is a screenshot of the final website:
