# refactor-horiseon-marketingsol

This project required to carefully review the codebase for a marketing agency's website called "Horiseon" and refactor it in order to make it more organized and clear.

The changes included:

- Replacing multiple HTML elements and edit the names for some of the ids and classes. 

- Some of the CSS selectors were deleted since they were repetitive and unnecessary.
  
- The title was changed from "website" to the actual name displyed in the footer to be consistent.
 
- In the header section, the word "Horiseon" did not have a logical structure, thus it was rewritten by putting the "span" and  "h1" tags in the right place. 

- The link for the Search Engine Optimization navigation item was not working at all, thus it was necessary to add the respective "id" inside the anchor element.
  
- The main image code was established in the CSS file, thus it was established in the HTML file with its corresponding "alt" attribute.

- The "alt" attribute was added into all images tags.

- Comments in the CSS file were stated according to the organization of the semantic HTML elements. 


Here is a screenshot of the final website:
